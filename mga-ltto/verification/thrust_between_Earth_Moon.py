## Context
"""
This example demonstrates the a basic use of thrust in the Earth-Moon system.

Thrust is implemented to be of constant magnitude, and be co-linear with velocity, pushing the simulated vehicle from behind.
In addition to the acceleration from the thrust, a basic model is setup, consisting of the acceleration of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, only considering them as Point Masses.

The mass of the vehicle is also propagated, using a mass rate model made to be consistent with the rocket thrust used.

How to setup dependent variables to save the mass and altitude of the vehicle over time is also demonstrated.

Termination settings based on the minimum mass of the vehicle and its maximum altitude are also shown.

Finally, how to plot the trajectory of the vehicle and of the Moon in 3D is demonstrated.
For this, this example also shows how to extract the position of the Moon over time from SPICE.

## Import statements
"""
The required import statements are made here, at the very beginning.

Some standard modules are first loaded. These are `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Then, the different modules of `tudatpy` that will be used are imported.

## Configuration
"""
NAIF's `SPICE` kernels are first loaded, so that the position of various bodies such as the Earth can be make known to `tudatpy`.

Then, the start and end simulation epochs are setups. In this case, the start epoch is set to `1e7`, corresponding to 10 million seconds ($\approx$ 115.74 days) after the 1st of January 2000.

The times should always be specified in seconds since J2000.

### Create the bodies
"""
Bodies can be created by making a list of strings with the bodies that is to be included in the simulation.

The default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from `SPICE`.

These settings can be adjusted. Please refere to the [Available Environment Models](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/create_models/available.html#available-environment-models) in the user guide for more details.

First off, the acceleration settings that act on the Vehicle are to be defined.
In this case, these consist in the followings:
- Acceleration from the constant thrust, using the settings defined earlier.
- Graviational acceleration from the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun, all modeled as Point Masses.

The acceleration settings defined are then applied to the Vehicle in a dictionary.

This dictionary is finally input to the propagation setup to create the acceleration models.

Let's now define a set of termination conditions. In this setup, once a single one of them is fulfilled, the propagation stops.

### Create the propagator settings
"""
The propagator settings are now defined.

As usual, translational propagation settings are defined, using a Cowell propagator.

Finally, a multitype propagator is defined, encompassing both the translational and the mass propagators.

### Create the integrator settings
"""
The last step before starting the simulation is to setup the integrator that will be used.

## Propagate the orbit
"""
The orbit from the Earth to the Moon is now ready to be propagated.

This is done by calling the `SingleArcSimulator()` function of the `numerical_simulation module`.
This function requires the `system_of_bodies`, `integrator_settings`, and `propagator_settings` that have all been defined earlier.

After this, the history of the propagated state over time, containing both the position and velocity history, is extracted.
This history, taking the form of a dictionary, is then converted to an array containing 7 columns:
- Column 0: Time history, in seconds since J2000.
- Columns 1 to 3: Position history, in meters, in the frame that was specified in the `body_settings`.
- Columns 4 to 6: Velocity history, in meters per second, in the frame that was specified in the `body_settings`.

The same is done with the dependent variable history. The column indexes corresponding to a given dependent variable in the `dep_vars` variable are printed when the simulation is run, when `SingleArcSimulator()` is called.
Do mind that converting to an ndarray using the `result2array()` utility will shift these indexes, since the first column (index 0) will then be the times.
